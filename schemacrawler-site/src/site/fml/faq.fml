      <question> What is SchemaCrawler? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          SchemaCrawler is an open-source Java API that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with
          plain old Java
          objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          SchemaCrawler is also a command-line tool to output your database schema and data in a
          readable form.
          The output
          is designed to be
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff-ed</a>
          with previous versions of your database schema.

      <question> What does SchemaCrawler output look like? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          SchemaCrawler can produce
          <a href="snapshot-examples/snapshot.txt">plain text,</a>
          <a href="snapshot-examples/snapshot.csv">comma-separated text (CSV),</a>
          <a href="snapshot-examples/snapshot.html">HTML5,</a>
          or
          <a href="snapshot-examples/snapshot.json">JavaScript object notation (JSON).</a>
          The HTML5 output is a combination of valid XML (that can be manipulated by XML tools or XSLT), and HTML that
          can be viewed in a browser. SchemaCrawler can produce output in the
          <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html ">DOT format,</a>
          which
          <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>

    <faq id="commands">
      <question> What are the SchemaCrawler commands? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The easiest way to see the SchemaCrawler commands is to download and install SchemaCrawler, and run the
          provided scripts (
          <code>schemacrawler.sh</code>
          on Unix, and
          <code>schemacrawler.cmd</code>
          on Windows). Detailed command-line help will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          SchemaCrawler can produce listings, and standard, or verbose details of your schema. The brief schema option
          gives you
          just table, view, stored procedure and function names. The standard schema option gives you the column names and
          primary keys.
          The verbose schema option will give you details of data types, indexes, primary and foreign keys,
          view, stored procedure and function definitions. The SchemaCrawler command can be combined with an
          <i>infolevel</i>
          , which determines the level of detail of schema metadata obtained. The maximum infolevel will give you
          privileges, triggers definitions, and check constraints. Each successive option takes
          more time to execute.
        </p>
        <p>SchemaCrawler provides commands for producing graphs and running templates, if the appropriate extensions are
          installed.
        </p>
        <p> SchemaCrawler can also manipulate your data. You can get counts of the rows in tables and views.
          SchemaCrawler can output all the data in your tables and views, or run specific SQL statements against table
          and views. SchemaCrawler can be fine-tuned using configuration files.

        <p>
          Weak associations are inferred associations between tables, similar to foreign keys, even if there is no
          foreign key defined in the database schema between the tables. Ruby on Rails table schemes are supported, as well as
          other simple naming conventions. Table name prefixes are automatically detected. Weak associations are output
          in the graphs as a dotted line, and are also output in the text formats.
