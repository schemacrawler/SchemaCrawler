SchemaCrawler 16.10.1
Database schema discovery and comprehension tool

Copyright (c) 2000-2020, Sualeh Fatehi <sualeh@hotmail.com>.

You can search for database schema objects using regular expressions,
and output the schema and data in a readable text format. You can find
potential schema design issues with lint. The output serves for
database documentation is designed to be diff-ed against other database
schemas. SchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams.

Available SchemaCrawler commands:
 brief          Shows basic schema information, for tables, views and routines,
                  columns, primary keys, and foreign keys
 count          Shows counts of rows in the tables
 details        Shows maximum possible detail of the schema, including
                  privileges, and details of privileges, triggers, and check
                  constraints
 dump           Shows data from all rows in the tables
 list           Shows a list of schema objects
 quickdump      Shows data from all rows in the tables, but row order is not
                  guaranteed - this can be used with a minimum info-level for
                  speed
 schema         Shows the commonly needed detail of the schema, including
                  details of tables, views and routines, columns, primary keys,
                  indexes, foreign keys, and triggers
 test-command   Test command which is not deployed with the release
 <query_name>   Shows results of query <query_name>, as specified in the
                  configuration properties file
 <query>        Shows results of SQL <query>
                The query itself can contain the variables ${table}, ${columns}
                  and ${tabletype}, or system properties referenced as
                  ${<system-property-name>}
                Queries without any variables are executed exactly once
                Queries with variables are executed once for each table, with
                  the variables substituted


Available SchemaCrawler database plugins:

** Turn logging on or off
Shell Command:
log

Options:
      --log-level=<loglevel>
         Set log level using one of OFF, SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE,
           FINER, FINEST, ALL
         Optional, defaults to OFF


** Load SchemaCrawler configuration from the classpath and file
Shell Command:
config-file

SchemaCrawler configuration reads a resource called schemacrawler.config.
properties from the CLASSPATH, which includes the lib/ folder. You can modify
the default settings in this file.

The order of loading configuration settings is:
1. From a CLASSPATH resource called schemacrawler.config.properties
2. Which can be overridden by settings in a configuration file (see below)
3. Which can be overridden by other command-line options

Command-line options will override configuration file options.

Options:
  -g, --config-file=<configfile>
         Read SchemaCrawler configuration properties from <configfile>
         <configfile> is the full path to the configuration file
         Optional, uses the default schemacrawler.config.properties file in the
           current directory, or in-built default options


** Connect to the database
Shell Command:
connect

For database connections, please read
https://www.schemacrawler.com/database-support.html
first, before running SchemaCrawler

Options:
      --password=<password>
                          Database password
      --password:env=<environment variable name>
                          Database password, from an environmental variable
                            value
      --password:file=<path to password file>
                          Database password, read from a file
      --password:prompt   Database password, prompted from the console
      --user=<user>       Database user name

For connecting to specific databases, use
      --database=<database>
                          Database name
      --host=<host>       Database server host
      --port=<port>       Database server port
      --server=<database system identifier>
                          Where <database system identifier> is a database for
                            which a SchemaCrawler plug-in is available
                          Use one of test-db
      --urlx=<String=String>
                          JDBC URL additional properties

If your database does not have a SchemaCrawler plug-in, use
      --url=<connectionUrl>
                          JDBC connection URL to the database


** Limit database object metadata
Shell Command:

                              produced.
                            Or, use:
                              scdot - For Graphviz DOT output, for schema only
