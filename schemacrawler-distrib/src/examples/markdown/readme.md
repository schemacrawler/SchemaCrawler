# SchemaCrawler

## Introduction

Please review the [SchemaCrawler website](https://www.schemacrawler.com/) for FAQs, how-tos, and so on. 
This download contains the main SchemaCrawler distribution, as well as examples. You can extend the 
SchemaCrawler distribution by downloading additional libraries that SchemaCrawler integrates with. You can also 
download additional JDBC drivers, and have SchemaCrawler pick them up automatically. Once you are happy 
with the customization of your installation, you can copy the `_schemacrawler` folder to any location 
on your system, and use it from there.

## Examples

This folder contains a number of examples, as well as a database server that has an example schema and 
data. Each folder illustrates a SchemaCrawler capability. Read the readme file in each example folder 
for instructions.
