allowLoadLocalInfile                                   [driver property]
  Should the driver allow use of 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE...' (defaults to 'true').
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

allowMasterDownConnections                             [driver property]
  Should replication-aware driver establish connections to slaves when connection to master servers cannot be established at initial connection?  Defaults to 'false', which will cause SQLException when configured master hosts are all unavailable when establishing a new replication-aware Connection.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

allowMultiQueries                                      [driver property]
  Allow the use of ';' to delimit multiple queries during one statement (true/false), defaults to 'false', and does not affect the addBatch() and executeBatch() methods, which instead rely on rewriteBatchStatements.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

allowNanAndInf                                         [driver property]

  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

allowUrlInLocalInfile                                  [driver property]

  value                             false                       

alwaysSendSetIsolation                                 [driver property]
  Should the driver always communicate with the database when Connection.setTransactionIsolation() is called? If set to false, the driver will only communicate with the database when the requested transaction isolation is different than the whichever is newer, the last value that was set via Connection.setTransactionIsolation(), or the value that was read from the server when the connection was established.  Note that useLocalSessionState=true will force the same behavior as alwaysSendSetIsolation=false, regardless of how alwaysSendSetIsolation is set.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

authenticationPlugins                                  [driver property]
  Comma-delimited list of classes that implement com.mysql.jdbc.AuthenticationPlugin and which will be used for authentication unless disabled by "disabledAuthenticationPlugins" property.
  not required
  value                             NULL                        

autoClosePStmtStreams                                  [driver property]
  Should the driver automatically call .close() on streams/readers passed as arguments via set*() methods?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

autoDeserialize                                        [driver property]
  Should the driver automatically detect and de-serialize objects stored in BLOB fields?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false

autoReconnect                                          [driver property]
  Should the driver try to re-establish stale and/or dead connections? If enabled the driver will throw an exception for a queries issued on a stale or dead connection, which belong to the current transaction, but will attempt reconnect before the next query issued on the connection in a new transaction. The use of this feature is not recommended, because it has side effects related to session state and data consistency when applications don't handle SQLExceptions properly, and is only designed to be used when you are unable to configure your application to handle SQLExceptions resulting from dead and stale connections properly. Alternatively, as a last option, investigate setting the MySQL server variable "wait_timeout" to a high value, rather than the default of 8 hours.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false

  Instead of using slowQueryThreshold* to determine if a query is slow enough to be logged, maintain statistics that allow the driver to determine queries that are outside the 99th percentile?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

blobsAreStrings                                        [driver property]
  Should the driver always treat BLOBs as Strings - specifically to work around dubious metadata returned by the server for GROUP BY clauses?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false

  A comma-delimited list of user-defined key:value pairs (in addition to standard MySQL-defined key:value pairs) to be passed to MySQL Server for display as connection attributes in the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.SESSION_CONNECT_ATTRS table.  Example usage:  connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2:value2  This functionality is available for use with MySQL Server version 5.6 or later only.  Earlier versions of MySQL Server do not support connection attributes, causing this configuration option will be ignored.  Setting connectionAttributes=none will cause connection attribute processing to be bypassed, for situations where Connection creation/initialization speed is critical.
  not required
  value                             NULL

defaultAuthenticationPlugin                            [driver property]
  Name of a class implementing com.mysql.jdbc.AuthenticationPlugin which will be used as the default authentication plugin (see below). It is an error to use a class which is not listed in "authenticationPlugins" nor it is one of the built-in plugins. It is an error to set as default a plugin which was disabled with "disabledAuthenticationPlugins" property. It is an error to set this value to null or the empty string (i.e. there must be at least a valid default authentication plugin specified for the connection, meeting all constraints listed above).
  not required
  value                             com.mysql.jdbc.authentication.MysqlNativePasswordPlugin

defaultFetchSize                                       [driver property]
  The driver will call setFetchSize(n) with this value on all newly-created Statements
  not required
  value                             0                           

detectCustomCollations                                 [driver property]
  Should the driver detect custom charsets/collations installed on server (true/false, defaults to 'false'). If this option set to 'true' driver gets actual charsets/collations from server each time connection establishes. This could slow down connection initialization significantly.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

disabledAuthenticationPlugins                          [driver property]
  Comma-delimited list of classes implementing com.mysql.jdbc.AuthenticationPlugin or mechanisms, i.e. "mysql_native_password". The authentication plugins or mechanisms listed will not be used for authentication which will fail if it requires one of them. It is an error to disable the default authentication plugin (either the one named by "defaultAuthenticationPlugin" property or the hard-coded one if "defaultAuthenticationPlugin" property is not set).
  not required
  value                             NULL                        

disconnectOnExpiredPasswords                           [driver property]
  If "disconnectOnExpiredPasswords" is set to "false" and password is expired then server enters "sandbox" mode and sends ERR(08001, ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD) for all commands that are not needed to set a new password until a new password is set.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

dontTrackOpenResources                                 [driver property]
  The JDBC specification requires the driver to automatically track and close resources, however if your application doesn't do a good job of explicitly calling close() on statements or result sets, this can cause memory leakage. Setting this property to true relaxes this constraint, and can be more memory efficient for some applications. Also the automatic closing of the Statement and current ResultSet in Statement.closeOnCompletion() and Statement.getMoreResults ([Statement.CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT | Statement.CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS]), respectively, ceases to happen. This property automatically sets holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose=true.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false

  value                             true                        

dumpQueriesOnException                                 [driver property]
  Should the driver dump the contents of the query sent to the server in the message for SQLExceptions?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

dynamicCalendars                                       [driver property]
  Should the driver retrieve the default calendar when required, or cache it per connection/session?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

elideSetAutoCommits                                    [driver property]
  If using MySQL-4.1 or newer, should the driver only issue 'set autocommit=n' queries when the server's state doesn't match the requested state by Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

emptyStringsConvertToZero                              [driver property]

emulateLocators                                        [driver property]
  Should the driver emulate java.sql.Blobs with locators? With this feature enabled, the driver will delay loading the actual Blob data until the one of the retrieval methods (getInputStream(), getBytes(), and so forth) on the blob data stream has been accessed. For this to work, you must use a column alias with the value of the column to the actual name of the Blob. The feature also has the following restrictions: The SELECT that created the result set must reference only one table, the table must have a primary key; the SELECT must alias the original blob column name, specified as a string, to an alternate name; the SELECT must cover all columns that make up the primary key. 
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

emulateUnsupportedPstmts                               [driver property]
  Should the driver detect prepared statements that are not supported by the server, and replace them with client-side emulated versions?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true                        

enablePacketDebug                                      [driver property]

  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

enableQueryTimeouts                                    [driver property]
  When enabled, query timeouts set via Statement.setQueryTimeout() use a shared java.util.Timer instance for scheduling. Even if the timeout doesn't expire before the query is processed, there will be memory used by the TimerTask for the given timeout which won't be reclaimed until the time the timeout would have expired if it hadn't been cancelled by the driver. High-load environments might want to consider disabling this functionality.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true

  Comma-delimited list of classes that implement com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor. These classes will be instantiated one per Connection instance, and all SQLExceptions thrown by the driver will be allowed to be intercepted by these interceptors, in a chained fashion, with the first class listed as the head of the chain.

  value                             NULL                        

explainSlowQueries                                     [driver property]
  If 'logSlowQueries' is enabled, should the driver automatically issue an 'EXPLAIN' on the server and send the results to the configured log at a WARN level?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false

gatherPerfMetrics                                      [driver property]
  Should the driver gather performance metrics, and report them via the configured logger every 'reportMetricsIntervalMillis' milliseconds?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

generateSimpleParameterMetadata                        [driver property]
  Should the driver generate simplified parameter metadata for PreparedStatements when no metadata is available either because the server couldn't support preparing the statement, or server-side prepared statements are disabled?
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             false                       

getProceduresReturnsFunctions                          [driver property]
  Pre-JDBC4 DatabaseMetaData API has only the getProcedures() and getProcedureColumns() methods, so they return metadata info for both stored procedures and functions. JDBC4 was extended with the getFunctions() and getFunctionColumns() methods and the expected behaviours of previous methods are not well defined. For JDBC4 and higher, default 'true' value of the option means that calls of DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns() return metadata for both procedures and functions as before, keeping backward compatibility. Setting this property to 'false' decouples Connector/J from its pre-JDBC4 behaviours for DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns(), forcing them to return metadata for procedures only.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
  value                             true

  If using a load-balanced connection to connect to SQL nodes in a MySQL Cluster/NDB configuration (by using the URL prefix "jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://"), which load balancing algorithm should the driver use: (1) "random" - the driver will pick a random host for each request. This tends to work better than round-robin, as the randomness will somewhat account for spreading loads where requests vary in response time, while round-robin can sometimes lead to overloaded nodes if there are variations in response times across the workload. (2) "bestResponseTime" - the driver will route the request to the host that had the best response time for the previous transaction.

rewriteBatchedStatements                               [driver property]
  Should the driver use multiqueries (irregardless of the setting of "allowMultiQueries") as well as rewriting of prepared statements for INSERT into multi-value inserts when executeBatch() is called? Notice that this has the potential for SQL injection if using plain java.sql.Statements and your code doesn't sanitize input correctly. Notice that for prepared statements, server-side prepared statements can not currently take advantage of this rewrite option, and that if you don't specify stream lengths when using PreparedStatement.set*Stream(), the driver won't be able to determine the optimum number of parameters per batch and you might receive an error from the driver that the resultant packet is too large. Statement.getGeneratedKeys() for these rewritten statements only works when the entire batch includes INSERT statements. Please be aware using rewriteBatchedStatements=true with INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE that for rewritten statement server returns only one value as sum of all affected (or found) rows in batch and it isn't possible to map it correctly to initial statements; in this case driver returns 0 as a result of each batch statement if total count was 0, and the Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO as a result of each batch statement if total count was > 0.

  Don't set the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag when connecting to the server (not JDBC-compliant, will break most applications that rely on "found" rows vs. "affected rows" for DML statements), but does cause "correct" update counts from "INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" statements to be returned by the server.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]

useColumnNamesInFindColumn                             [driver property]
  Prior to JDBC-4.0, the JDBC specification had a bug related to what could be given as a "column name" to ResultSet methods like findColumn(), or getters that took a String property. JDBC-4.0 clarified "column name" to mean the label, as given in an "AS" clause and returned by ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel(), and if no AS clause, the column name. Setting this property to "true" will give behavior that is congruent to JDBC-3.0 and earlier versions of the JDBC specification, but which because of the specification bug could give unexpected results. This property is preferred over "useOldAliasMetadataBehavior" unless you need the specific behavior that it provides with respect to ResultSetMetadata.
  not required; choices [false, no, true, yes]
