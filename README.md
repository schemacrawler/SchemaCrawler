> Please see the [SchemaCrawler website](http://www.schemacrawler.com/) for more details.

SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can [search for database schema objects](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/schemacrawler_grep.html) using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database documentation, and is designed to be [diff-ed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) against other database schemas. SchemaCrawler also generates [schema diagrams.](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/diagramming.html) You can [execute scripts](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/scripting.html) in any standard scripting language against your database. You can find potential schema design issues with [lint](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/lint.html). SchemaCrawler is available under a number of [licenses](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/license.html).

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is [bundled with drivers](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/database-support.html) for some commonly used RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports Java SE 8 or better.

SchemaCrawler is also a Java API that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with plain old Java objects.

All SchemaCrawler jars are in the [Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aus.fatehi%20a%3Aschemacrawler*). They can be used as dependencies in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects, or with any other build system that supports the Central Repository. [Pre-packaged Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/sualeh/schemacrawler/) are on Docker Hub. [Download releases with tutorials from GitHub.](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler/releases)

An (unsupported) back-port of SchemaCrawler to Java  7 is available at [sualeh/SchemaCrawler-Java7-Backport](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler-Java7-Backport).
