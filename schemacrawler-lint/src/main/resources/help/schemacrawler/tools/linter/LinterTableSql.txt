Allows you to run SQL against the database. The SQL statement must 
return exactly one column and one row of data in the results. If one row 
is returned, it means that the lint has detected a problem. However, if 
no rows of data are returned, it means that there are no issues. 
Notice the use of ${table} to indicate the name of the table the lint 
is running against.
Example configuration:
<schemacrawler-linter-configs>
  <linter id="schemacrawler.tools.linter.LinterTableSql">
    <config>
      <property name="message">message for custom SQL lint</property>
      <property name="sql"><![CDATA[SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM ${table}]]></property>
    </config>
  </linter>
</schemacrawler-linter-configs>
