Allows you to run SQL against the database. The SQL statement must 
return exactly one column and one row of data in the results. If one row 
is returned, it means that the lint has detected a problem. However, if 
no rows of data are returned, it means that there are no issues. 
Example configuration:
<linter id="schemacrawler.tools.linter.LinterCatalogSql">
  <config>
    <property name="message">message for SQL catalog lint</property>
    <property name="sql">SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES</property>
  </config>
</linter>
