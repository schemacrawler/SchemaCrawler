# Instructions for Java Projects Using Apache Maven## General Coding Guidelines- Prefer **immutability** and use the `final` keyword for fields, parameters, and local variables when appropriate.- Follow **Java 8 best practices**, including usage of `Optional`, `Streams`, and functional programming where applicable.- Ensure **thread safety** by avoiding mutable shared state and using synchronized wrappers or concurrency utilities when necessary.- Use **meaningful names** for classes, methods, and variables to improve code readability.- Follow **SOLID principles** to enhance maintainability and scalability.- Write meaningful **javadocs** for functions and classes.## Project Structure- Organize packages based on functionality (e.g., `service`, `repository`, `controller`).- Use **Apache Maven** for build management and dependency resolution.- Maintain a **consistent project structure**, following standard conventions.## Dependencies and Versions- Define **explicit versions** for dependencies to prevent compatibility issues.- Prefer **dependency management** using `dependencyManagement` in `pom.xml` for centralized version control.- Use **dependency exclusions** where necessary to avoid unwanted transitive dependencies.## Testing and Quality- Write **unit tests** for business logic using JUnit 5 with Hamcrest matchers.- Use **Mockito** for mocking dependencies in tests.- Maintain **high test coverage** to ensure reliability.
