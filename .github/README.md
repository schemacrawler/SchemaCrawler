## About

SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can [search for database schema objects](https://www.schemacrawler.com/schemacrawler-grep.html) using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database documentation, and is designed to be [diff-ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) against other database schemas. SchemaCrawler also generates [schema diagrams.](https://www.schemacrawler.com/diagramming.html) You can [execute scripts](https://www.schemacrawler.com/scripting.html) in any standard scripting language against your database. You can find potential schema design issues with [lint](https://www.schemacrawler.com/lint.html).

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is [bundled with drivers](https://www.schemacrawler.com/database-support.html) for some commonly used RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports Java SE 17 or better.

[SchemaCrawler is also a Java API](https://dev.to/sualeh/how-to-get-database-metadata-as-java-pojos-24li) that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with plain old Java objects.
