## Guidelines for Support

Some guidelines for a quick response on [Stack Overflow] and the [SchemaCrawler discussions page]:

- Please explain the issue briefly, and specify the versions of SchemaCrawler, Java, 
  operating system, database, and JDBC driver that you are using - the 
  best way to do this is to run SchemaCrawler with an additional `-T` argument, and 
  capture the output
- Provide the steps that you took to reproduce the issue, and any steps that you took to 
  solve the issue
- Zip and attach the SchemaCrawler debug logs, which can be obtained by running 
  SchemaCrawler with an additional `--log-level=ALL` command-line argument
