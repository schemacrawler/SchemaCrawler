## Building From the Source Code

### Pre-requisites for Building
- Install the latest version of [Java]
- Install [Graphviz], and put it on your system `PATH`

## Apache Maven Build
The [Apache Maven] build is a comprehensive build that runs unit tests, constructs the
SchemaCrawler jar, and can also create the project web-site.

- Install [Apache Maven], and make sure it is on your classpath
- Open a command console in the SchemaCrawler directory
- Run `mvn package`

You can create the  SchemaCrawler distribution by running `mvn -Ddistrib package`. The SchemaCrawler distribution will be created in the `target` of the `schemacrawler-distrib` module.

## Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA
Before importing the various SchemaCrawler projects into [Eclipse] or [IntelliJ IDEA], make sure that you have a successful [Apache Maven] build. [Apache Maven] will download all the dependencies needed to build SchemaCrawler.
